Intended solution for sub1:
    greedy: take all lectures that you can

Wrong solutions and their hardcoded breaking cases:
    1. slow algorithms/dp array too small: L,H=1000, optimal solution must take all lectures
    2. forgot long longs: big skill increases, small cost
    3. forgot to consider final lecture: solution is to take up to the last lecture, with some hours remaining
    4. same thing, but worse: solution is to expend all our hours on last lecture
    5. went over the hours limit of H: have two lectures, one that costs H hours, and another in another topic that costs 1 hour
    6. used under the limit of H: the optimal solution must use lectures that add up to H hours
    7. bad base case: use only one lecture that is H hours long
    8. bad looping: use only one lecture that is not H hours long
