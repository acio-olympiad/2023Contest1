Intended solution for sub4:
    3-dimensional dp:
    dp[prefix of topics][lecture number][hours left]

Wrong solutions and their hardcoded breaking cases:
    1. slow algorithms/dp array too small: N,L,H=100, optimal solution must take all lectures of topic 100
    2. forgot to include {0,0} for a topic: have an empty topic so dp[i][j] for some constant i and variable j is uninitialised
    3. forgot long longs: big skill increases, small cost
    4. forgot to consider dp[i][0]: solution is to expend all our hours
    5. used the recurrence even when j+hours_k>H: have two lectures, one that costs H hours, and another in another topic that costs 1 hour
    6. used only options where j+hours_k<=H-1: the optimal solution must use a lecture that is H hours long
    7. output answer as dp[N][H] or dp[N][0] or something specific like that: make the answer dp[N][4]
    8. output answer as max(dp[N][i]) for 1<=i<=H: make the answer dp[N][0]
